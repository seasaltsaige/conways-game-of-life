After falling down a rabbit hole of celular automita, I finally decided to challenge myself to create the most famous one myself.

## Conways Game of Life
Initially I had planned to keep it simple, and restrict the domain of the field that you can build in, but I ended up getting side tracked, as, well, the logic itself for the automita is rather simple, so I challenged myself to create a completely infinite grid space to build in. While I did achieve this, my code is rather poorly opitimized, so it quickly begins to run far too slow to build anything meaningful. Still a fun project that taught me quite a bit!
